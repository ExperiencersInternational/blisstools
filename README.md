## Downloading Guide

When downloading from Roblox, ignore this following guide, but if you are downloading from GitHub releases, follow this to get setup easily!

1. When clicking on the ZIP file for the release, if your browser has an 'Open' option, press that instead of saving.
2. Find blisstools.rbxmx in the ZIP file and paste it into %localappdata%\Roblox\Plugins (if Windows can't find this folder, or if you're on Mac, go into Roblox Studio > Open a game/template > Plugins button in Studio ribbon tab > Plugins Folder, and paste blisstools.rbxmx there)

## Making contributions

Contributions are absolutely appreciated! We know that this project is not using Rojo, and I have no plans to, editing UI is better visually imo, but if you want to add new features without moving it onto Rojo, feel free to!

If you're making a fork, please follow the licensing terms in license.txt, and please make a fork of roblox.com/library/8741310303 and update the version number to the version your plugin is on, so your forks don't constantly display an update notification.
