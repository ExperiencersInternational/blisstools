## Downloading Guide

When downloading from Roblox, ignore this following guide, but if you are downloading from GitHub releases, follow this to get setup easily!

1. When clicking on the ZIP file for the release, if your browser has an 'Open' option, press that instead of saving.
2. Find blisstools.rbxmx in the ZIP file and paste it into %localappdata%\Roblox\Plugins (if Windows can't find this folder, or if you're on Mac, go into Roblox Studio > Open a game/template > Plugins button in Studio ribbon tab > Plugins Folder, and paste blisstools.rbxmx there)
